# Life expectancy

Presenting regression problem where we have to predict the life expectancy prediction using #machinelearning .

1..Imported the libraries and dataset.

2..Used exploratory data analysis techniques such as #seaborn and #matplotib to understand the data distribution and identify correlation between variables using univariate and multivariate analysis.

3..Data preprocessing techniques such as dropping null values and changing data types, encoding categorical variables using #Labelencoder and scaling using #Standardscaler are performed.

4..Outlier treatment is performed using the Inter Quartile Range method.

5..Model selection #LinearRegression #Ridge #LinearSVR #DescionTreeRegressor #GradientBoostRegressor #AdaBoostRegressor #RandomForestRegressor are used.

6..Splitting the data into training and testing (by train_test_split) [80,20]

7..The model's performances are evaluated using accuracy score.

8..Predicted the output using model which have high accuracy ie, #linearregression

9..At last compared the actual and predicted value.
